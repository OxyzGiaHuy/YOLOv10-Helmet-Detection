# Helmet Safety Detection using YOLOv10

**Project Description:**

This project utilizes the YOLOv10 model to detect safety helmets in images and videos. Safety helmets are crucial protective gear that safeguards workers from head injuries. Helmet detection can help ensure safety compliance and prevent accidents.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Access Colab:**

2. **Train the Model:**

* Run the Colab notebook cells to train the model.

3. **Run Prediction:**

* Modify the `IMG_URL` variables to point to the image or video you want to predict on.
* Run the final Colab notebook cell to perform prediction.

**Notes:**

* This project requires a GPU for training the model.
* This is an experimental version and the model will be further improved. In the future, it may be deployed on Streamlit.
